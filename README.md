# Final Project

[Erasmus+ Duration](project/project_report_bayesian.pdf) - Modelling the duration of Erasmus+ exchanges for students using official data gathered by the EU on mobility periods started in 2019. We use a Bayesian framework with a special case of finite mixture models, doing model validation and comparisons using some ad-hoc statistics in the data. Some more models are proposed finally, in hopes of providing inspiration for further developments ([Files](project)).

Also made a [presentation](project/UlrikAlexPresentation.pdf) of our project for our peers. Got feedback on the progress from classmates and lecturers, which came in handy when completing the project. 

*Abstract*

The duration of Erasmus+ stays abroad is modelled using a Bayesian framework. Finite mixture models
are employedâ€”both because of the observed data and because of expectations concerning the durations,
which seem to usually be either one or two semesters. Four different models are tested, in order of increasing
complexity, with the purpose of finding a model that models the duration adequately. The conclusion is
that the suggested models can be implemented successfully, where the success is measured by some ad-hoc
statistics. In additon, the exchange duration seems to depend on the gender and the age of each student;
females and younger students seem to go for slightly shorter durations when comparing to males and older
students. Finally, some more models are proposed without thorough investigation, in hopes of providing
inspiration for further improvement of the procedure and the results
